## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a set of clustering exercises that cover both the theoretical and practical aspects of clustering. These exercises are designed to help you:

- Understand different clustering algorithms.
- Implement clustering algorithms using popular machine learning libraries.
- Apply clustering to real-world datasets.
- Evaluate the performance of clustering models.

Feel free to use these exercises for self-study, educational purposes, or as a reference while working on clustering projects.

## Clustering Algorithms

The exercises in this repository cover various clustering algorithms, including but not limited to:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Spectral Clustering
- Agglomerative Clustering
- And more...

## Getting Started

To get started with the clustering exercises, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clustering-exercises.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd clustering-exercises

3. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies. You can use a virtual environment or a Conda environment for this purpose. You can find the list of required packages in the requirements.txt file.

4. Explore the exercise notebooks located in the exercises directory. Each exercise is organized in a Jupyter notebook and includes both instructions and code templates.

**Usage

Each exercise is self-contained in its Jupyter notebook file. You can open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the instructions provided in each exercise. Complete the code templates and experiment with different datasets to practice clustering techniques.

Happy clustering!

You can copy and paste this code into your repository's README.md file and customize it as needed. Don't forget to replace placeholders like `your-username` and `ExerciseName` with your actual information.
